# This project is no longer worked on and may not run as expected. Please be aware that this project may require maintenance or rework as the development is no longer worked on.
Unfortuantly, I can also no longer provide any support for this project as DiscordBot has become a thing of the past and is no longer needed. I may pick these up again or redevelop them in the future, but for now, they come as they are and may stop working at some point.

Just to save you a bit of time - any token information left in this repo is no longer active.

# How to use
Install onto your web server.

Rename config-default.php to config.php

Open config.php and enter in your database information, oauth bot information and change anything else you like.

Warning! This app requires you to have DiscordBot set up initially and using a MySQL database.
